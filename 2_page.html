        <p> As an independent nonprofit, our mission at GreatSchools is to help all parents get a great education for their children and for communities to ensure that all students receive a quality education. We believe that every parent — regardless of where they live or how much money they make — needs reliable information in order to ensure their child is being served by their school. On our profiles, we strive to display a variety of indicators of school quality to provide a well-rounded picture of how effectively each school serves all of its students. Our ratings are intended to provide a better understanding of school quality and to help parents compare schools within the same state. </p>
        <p>We are constantly working with state and national agencies to acquire more representative school data in every state. This helps us provide a more in-depth picture of school quality nationwide and allows us to improve our school profiles and ratings.</p>

        <h1 class="text-center">About GreatSchools’ ratings</h1>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <img src="C:\Users\Sirisha\Desktop\New folder\schol img\rating.png">
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <p>In the past, the overall GreatSchools Rating in most states was based on test scores. In some states*, the GreatSchools Rating was also based on student progress (or “growth”) and college readiness data (SAT/ACT participation and/or performance and/or graduation rates). Our school profiles now include important information in addition to test scores — factors that make a big difference in how children experience school, such as how much a school helps students improve academically, how well a school supports students from different socioeconomic, racial, and ethnic groups, and whether or not some groups of students are disproportionately affected by the school’s discipline and attendance policies. Many of these important themes now have their own rating, and these themed ratings are incorporated into the school’s overall GreatSchools Summary Rating.</p>
           <p>Note: Some states do not have sufficient information to generate a Summary Rating (Andhrapradesh, Mysore, and delhi). In these states, we default to the school’s Test Score Rating as the overall rating displayed at the top of the profile.</p>
           <p>GreatSchools ratings follow a 1-10 scale, where 10 is the highest and 1 is the lowest. Ratings at the lower end of the scale (1-4) signal that the school is “below average,” 5-6 indicate “average,” and 7-10 are “above average.” Each rating has its own color corresponding to this scale, ranging from green (10) to yellow to orange (1) to help you see the distinctions.</p>

<hr>
<h1 class="text-center">How do our ratings work?</h1>     
<h2>Summary Rating</h2>  
<p>The Summary Rating calculation is based on up to six of the school’s themed ratings/flags, which are described above. Components included within a school’s rating can vary based on data availability. For example, college readiness measures like Advanced Placement classes and college entrance exams are available in most high schools but not elementary or middle schools, and student or academic progress data that looks at year-over-year progress may be less likely to be available in a high school where state standardized tests are only given in one grade.</p>
<p>To calculate the Summary Rating, we use weights for each rating/flag based on the available data; the amount of information available about the school relative to other schools in the state; the amount of variability in the data; and the extent to which each data point has been proven to be related to student success in college and for long-term life outcomes.</p>
<p>Below are representative examples of how a high school or elementary school’s ratings are weighted within the overall Summary Rating calculation for the school:</p> 
<img src="C:\Users\Sirisha\Desktop\New folder\schol img\pic9.png">
<p>A snapshot of a school’s Summary Rating composition and weights can be found by clicking on the rating at the top of the profile. Inputs to the Summary Rating are school- and state-specific, depending on data availability. Each of the ratings (and flags) that comprise the Summary Rating may be refreshed as new data becomes available, which in turn may cause the school’s Summary Rating to change. These changes may happen at different times throughout the course of a year. To see when underlying data was updated, click on the Sources information for each rating and flag. Note: rounding of percentages may cause some Summary Rating weights to exceed 100%.</p>

<h2>Research partnerships</h2>
<p>GreatSchools strongly values research and wants to equip more researchers with our data so they can produce valuable insights on how education information can help parents and students. We invite research proposals that utilize GreatSchools’ data to answer education research questions, including:</p>
<br>
<h4>How do parents use education information? What kinds of school data has the largest influence on parents’ impressions of school quality, preferences, and/or education decisions?</h5> 
<ul>
<li>When parents are choosing a school, what sources of information do they seek out and rely on? What’s the value of information like GreatSchools and school-level report cards compared to social networks? What are ways to increase parent utilization of objective sources of information? How does this vary for students? </li>
<li> When viewing GreatSchools’ school profiles, what influence do they have on parents’ (and students’) views on school quality? On school preferences as measured by ranked lists, applications to or enrollment in schools?</li>
<li> What school information is best to support advocacy and advocacy actions? How GreatSchools’ school profiles influence parents’ and others’ actions in terms of engagement with and demand for better local schools?</li>
</ul><br>
<h4>What’s the best way to help parents support their child’s education?</h4>
<ul>
<li>What types of parent engagement activities have the largest influence on their children’s education success?</li>
<li>What’s the influence that GreatSchools’ parent content have on parents’ attitudes, knowledge, and behaviors related to support their child’s academic and social development?</li>
<li>How does increased parent engagement translate into child/student outcomes?</li>
</ul><br>
<h4>Proposal</h4>
<p>To request access to GreatSchools data, please review information on available data and related costs and then submit a short research proposal with the following information to research@greatschools.org:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your name, affiliation, and title</li>
<li>Primary research questions</li>
<li>Methodological approach</li>
<li>Expected benefits and implications of the study</li>
<li>Preliminary publication plans</li>
